In this work, we aim to build an end-to-end pipeline for assessing synaptic health to estimate treatment effects of Amyloid-β compound. The pipeline can be further applied to biomedical research to efficiently identify new compounds to protect against the treatment of Amyloid-β with potential to discover new drugs for Alzheimer’s disease.
