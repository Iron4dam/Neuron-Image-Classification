# Neuron-Image-Classification

In this work, we aim to build an end-to-end pipeline to estimate treatment effects of Amyloid-β compound in neuronal cells. The pipeline can be further applied to biomedical research to efficiently identify new compounds that protect cells against the treatment of Amyloid-β with potential to discover new drugs for Alzheimer’s disease.
